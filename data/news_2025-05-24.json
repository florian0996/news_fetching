    "published_at": "Fri, 23 May 2025 21:43:39 GMT",
    "content": "For fans of\u00a0Tom Cruise\u2019s\u00a0Mission: Impossible\u00a0series, the Pentagon can answer the incredulous question at the climax of\u00a0its latest trailer: \u201cYou gave him an\u00a0aircraft carrier?\u201d\nYes, the US Navy and Air Force Special Operations decided to accept the mission: help Cruise\u2019s secret agent Ethan Hunt save the world. Or, at least make a movie about it.\nFor\u00a0Paramount Global\u2019s\u00a0The Final Reckoning, released Friday in the US, Cruise and the crew spent three days in the Adriatic Sea filming aboard the\u00a0USS George H.W. Bush, a nuclear powered Nimitz-class carrier commissioned in 2009.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the latest cinematic incarnation of Cruise\u2019s career-long affinity for the US military and its aircraft (as well as doing his own stunts). It\u2019s also an example of the Pentagon\u2019s willingness to showcase its hardware and martial might through a classic piece of\u00a0American soft power, the Hollywood blockbuster.
