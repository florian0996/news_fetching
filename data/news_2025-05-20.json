After two hours talking with Putin, Trump said on\u00a0social media\u00a0that Ukraine and Russia would \"immediately start negotiations\" toward a ceasefire &mdash; but possibly without the US. There was no sanctions threat, no demand for a time-line, and no pressure on the Russian leader. Trump followed the Putin call by reaching out to European leaders, but already several governments were airing their disappointment. \n\nAfter months of failing to move Putin closer to peace, they fear Trump is pulling back from his efforts to end the war, leaving Ukraine and its allies on their own.
